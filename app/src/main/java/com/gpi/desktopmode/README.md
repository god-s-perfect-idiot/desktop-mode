# Desktop Mode - Refactored Code Structure

This document describes the refactored structure of the Desktop Mode Android application.

## File Organization

### Main Activity
- **`MainActivity.kt`** - Main activity that handles the app lifecycle and fullscreen setup
  - Contains only the activity logic and fullscreen configuration
  - Imports and uses the UI components from the `ui` package

### Data Models and Utilities
- **`DockApp.kt`** - Data class and utility functions
  - `DockApp` data class representing dock applications
  - `Drawable.toBitmap()` extension function for converting drawables to bitmaps

### UI Components (`ui/` package)
- **`MacOSDesktopScreen.kt`** - Main desktop screen composable
  - Contains the background gradient and overall layout
  - Imports and uses the `MacOSDock` component

- **`MacOSDock.kt`** - macOS-style dock composable
  - Handles dock layout, app list management, and hover effects
  - Manages pinned apps, recent apps, and dynamic spacing
  - Imports and uses the `DockIcon` component

- **`DockIcon.kt`** - Individual dock icon composable
  - Handles individual icon display, hover effects, and scaling animations
  - Manages icon rendering (app icons vs fallback icons)

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the app
4. **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
5. **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand

## Dependencies

- `MainActivity` → `ui.MacOSDesktopScreen`
- `MacOSDesktopScreen` → `ui.MacOSDock`
- `MacOSDock` → `ui.DockIcon` + `DockApp`
- `DockIcon` → `DockApp` + `Drawable.toBitmap()`

## Future Improvements

- Consider extracting app list management to a ViewModel
- Add unit tests for individual components
- Consider creating a theme file for colors and styling constants
- Add documentation for public composable functions
